            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> 
            canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]
            </sup>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which 
            the crowns of fully stocked trees do not toucheach other, 
            forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The 
            phenomenon is most prevalentamong trees of different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypothesis as to why crown 
            shyness is an adaptive behavior, and researchsuggests that it 
            might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

        <h1>Possible physiological exlanations</h1>

        <p>
            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.<sup>[6]
                </sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
                literature since the 1920's.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of 
                hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there 
                are multiple mechanisms across diffenert species, an example of 
                convergent eveloution. <br>[<i>citation needed</i>]
